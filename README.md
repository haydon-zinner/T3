Task

Build on the shadow template provided in class.
Integrate the single light source Phong shader into the shadowed scene.
Apply the shader to the provided model.
Allow movement around the scene.
The light's position is to be offset from the camera's position so that it appears you are carrying a torch in your hand. This will create the effect of holding a torch and walking down the scene.
